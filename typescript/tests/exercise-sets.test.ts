/**
 * Tests for the exerciseSets payload and the atomic-rejection retry (#567).
 *
 * The retry matters more than it looks. Garmin's PUT is atomic and names no
 * offender, so ONE exercise it dislikes 400s the whole payload and the user
 * loses every set. The bisection keeps every other name. Each branch of it is
 * covered here, including the case where several offenders are split across
 * halves and it has to give up on names entirely.
